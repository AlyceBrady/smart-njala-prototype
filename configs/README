RECOMMENDATION:  Copy or link the ramp/adminSettings directory under the
Smart settings directory, the ramp/docs directory under the docs
directory, ...

SMART needs to have an application.ini file in the configs directory,
but one is not provided in the NjalaSmartPrototype repository.
Instead, one should be built as part of the installation process.
Several files that serve as the basic building blocks for an
application.ini file are provided in the repository:
    ramp_basics.ini     defines some very basic properties
    ramp_defaults.ini   defines default values for properties common to
                            most or all RAMP applications
    smart_defaults.ini  defines default values for properties common to
                            Smart environments for Njala University

    template_custom_properties.ini  a template for customizing properties

To create an application.ini file for the RAMP Demo application, make a
copy of template_custom_properties.ini (called custom_properties.ini,
for example).  Edit it to customize the username and password that
SMART will use to access the database.  Customize any other
properties as appropriate (you may need to copy them from ramp_basics,
ramp_defaults, or smart_defaults first).

Then build your application.ini from the following files:
    ramp_basics.ini
    ramp_defaults.ini
    smart_defaults.ini
    custom_properties.ini
For example, on Unix/Linux/MacOS:
    cat ramp_basics.ini ramp_defaults.ini  smart_defaults >application.ini
    cat custom_properties.ini >>application.ini

If you are using git and for security reasons you do not want to add and
commit files with your database passwords, you may wish to add
custom_properties.ini and application.ini to your .gitignore file.
